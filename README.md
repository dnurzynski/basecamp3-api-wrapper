# Basecamp3 API Wrapper

A simple Ruby Wrapper for the Basecamp 3 API

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'basecamp3'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install basecamp3

## Basic usage

First, you have to establish a connection to Basecamp3.

    Basecamp3.connect(YOUR_BASECAMP3_ACCOUNT_ID, YOUR_BASECAMP3_ACCESS_TOKEN)

That's all. You can make requests now. 
E.g.: to get the TODO, just call the `find` method from the `Basecamp3::Todo` class:

    todo = Basecamp3::Todo.find(BUCKET_ID, TODO_ID)
    todo.content # = 'Hello world!'
